# Razor Component Authorisation Tests
This is a test site for trying out/demonstrating the application of authorisation rules (such as policies) against multiple Razor components/Blazor pages at once, including edge cases such as overriding the rules in subdirectories!

I've written [a blog post that goes with this solution](https://mattjameschampion.com/2022/03/31/applying-authorization-rules-to-a-folder-of-razor-components-blazor-pages/) if you wanted more information!
